## **Background**

This project looks at the trend of retail sales  during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This project focuses on the time period January 2020 to August 2020. 

As it is evident that the economy is battered as a result of the unfortunate pandemic, the project investigates trends in sales to highlight those areas that have been gravely affected and those that seem to thrive. Because of this pandemic, a public lock-down enforced by the government changed the way business is conducted. As a result of the measure, this project looked at the general trend in e-commerce activities with particular focus on the food sector, especially grocery shopping. The assumption is that food becomes a top priority as it is a neccesity to survive and endure the lockdown measure.

To perform the necessary data analysis effectively, the project is divided into 5 sections:

* Section 1: COVID-19 Confirmed Cases
* Section 2:  Retail Categories Sales
* Section 3:  E-Commerce
* Section 4: Retail Grocery
* Section 5: E-Grocery
